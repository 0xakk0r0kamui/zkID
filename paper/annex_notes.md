## Relevant Vocab:

_See full list of definitions [here]_(https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/1.1.0/arf/#2-definitions)

- **Relying Party** - verifier
- **Wallet Holder / User** - prover
- **EUDI Attribute Authority (EAA)** - issuer
- **OpenID4VP** - remote flow where user probes verifier, which then has to probe a remote wallet; see full standard [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)
- **QEAA** - document containing attestations (e.g. diplomas, student IDs, etc), slightly diff from PID in scope but same technically
- **Proximity flow** - ID verification over e.g. NFC tap rather than over a remote network connection
- **Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA)** - wallet provider's certificate to a wallet instance (to manage revocation)

## Main POC implementation notes:

- Has to support attestation in mDL standard [ISO18013-5] (CBOR data) and SD-JWT (JSON) formats
- Has to support presentation flows as as defined in mDL standard [ISO18013-5] and OpenID4VP standard for verifiable credentials

## Potential additional directions for POC:

Data minimization:

- PID Provider Trusted List (required) (Topic 1, Requirement OIA_12) -- theoretically can make issuer private (with e.g. Merkle inclusion proof). this is useful if the issuer has not issued many credentials, or the knowledge of the issuer itself provides a lot of information.
-

Unlinkability:

- Private proof-of-non-revocation flow (proposal) (Topic 7 and 38) -- public Merkle-tree registry of valid public keys / WIAs (latter preferred, since a list of public keys leaks / makes identity linkable from inspecting the device-binding signatures) for non-revoked/non-suspended credentials that issuer maintains, user provides proof (of ownership of a signed WIA) using Merkle inclusion proofs
- Private proof-of-assocation (proposal) (Topic 18) -- include verification of proof-of-association received from the WSCA/WSCD for credentials issued to different public keys controlled by secure device within the zkSNARK
- Private client-side in-circuit verification of WTE (proposal) (Topic 35) -- to prevent linking across user-issuer interactions, especially if issuers can be verifiers or other wallet users

Custom linkability:

- Self-maintained pseudonyms (proposal) (Topic 11) -- the pseudonym is a public nullifier output of the zkSNARK = hash(pk, random_salt), to eliminate need for an external pseudonym provider and allow for multiple pseudonyms controlled by the user
